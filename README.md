this is my second commit

to cheak the git version-> git version
to add name->git config.name"name"
to add email->git config.email"emailAddress"
to clone the repo-> git clone {URL of the repo}
to change the directory-->cd {file name}
to cheak the status--> git status
to see the how many file in our repo->ls
to see all hidden file -->ls -a
to add the file in repo--> 

we have some file type 
1.untraked->this is new file
2.stage->this is ready to commit
3.modified->some change in our file
4.unmodified->un changed file



_--------------add file --------------
add-> this is use to add to new file wich is we are working directory
   command---> git add<file name>;
   git commit m-"somemasse about the change of diretory"
   
push the code int our github-->git push origin main
-to back to the folder use -->cd ..
-to creatre the the new folder using terminal-->mkdir {file name};
-to create git repo--> git init
-to create new origin or jump another repo we use->git remote add origin {link of the repo};
-to cheak the we are which repo-->git remote -v
-to change our branch name -->git branch -M {name of the branch}
-to cheak we are which branch-->git branch
-to short the our origin main -->git push -u origin main/ then only type get push
-to creat new branch -->git cheakout -b {branch name}
-to  go to one branch to another branch -->git cheakout
-to delete the branch -->git branch -d
-to comapare the two branch for marge the branch-->git diff {which branch campar}
--  we can marege file using git hub to create pull request and campare the branch with main and then add the our file to another file
 this feature only add in git hub to add the marge to our vs code to write the next command-->git pull origin main

 if we are modified the same line then we can use the Resolving marge config 
 so we can marge the file on same line to thorow the error 
 - to use the marge to file -->git marge main
 but we change on same line then vs code throw the error this is is called the Resolving marge config
 -to talkal the problem we can use the this command-->to marge the two file and then we want which changes in our branch we can chose 
 and push the branch on our girhub both branch need to push
   

   if we by mistake delete some line or creat some changes in our file 
   this is also push but this is not commited this time we can use the command -->git reset [file name]


   if we can by mistake commit the change that time we can use this commond
   -->git reset HEAD~1
   this command actilhy mining our previos command to reset 

we can copy the code by any other account using the Fork
